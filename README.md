# Three-Dimensional-Nozzle-Design-Code

This package contains 3 programs written for the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler:

1) 2D Method of Characteristics, MOC_GRID_BDE
	- Computes a planar or axisymmetric two-dimensional nozzle contour based on user inputs using method of characteristics
	
2) Streamline Tracing Tool, STT2001
	- Performs streamline tracing on a supplied nozzle solution grid (usually generated by MOC_GRID_BDE)

3) 3D Method of Characteristics Design Tool, 3D_MOC
	- Computes three-dimensional flowfield properties for a given 3D nozzle contour. This could be a modified version of a nozzle contour generated by MOC_GRID_BDE.

	

Each program is contained in a separate folder containing source code and sample outputs. These programs are designed to use the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) libraries to generate the GUI windows for user input.

Detailed descriptions of the mathematical basis and operation of each program are provided in the attached report:
